Pretty Launcher

![preview](https://github.com/zw428/plaunch/blob/master/ex.png?raw=true)

`plaunch` is a minimal launcher written in python using `pyqt5` that displays a
list of items that run shell commands when chosen.

`plaunch` is meant to be used to launch any type of media, like games, movies,
playlists, etc., for those who want a nicer visual representation of what they
have to choose from.

## Usage

`python pylaunch.py filename`

File should have lines formatted as: `"image_filename","title","shell_command"`

for example, one of my lines looks like this: `"dcss.png","DCSS","crawl-tiles"`

## Using

Single click to select, arrow key navigation, double click or enter to launch,
`ctrl-F` to filter. You can also jump to an entry by pressing the first letter
of its title.

## Plans:
- nicer styling
